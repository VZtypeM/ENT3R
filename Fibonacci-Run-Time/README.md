# About this project

This project demonstrates the difference in runtime for different algorithms doing the same thing. 
One algorithm is O(n) and is lightning fast the other is O(1.618^n) and is painfully slow. 

The main part of the project is the python notebook (The .ipynb file) which includes all the code you need and text describing it. 
For convenience I have also included separate python files with the different algorithms

The point is not that the students will understand all the code, it is plenty if they are surprised by how large the difference in time is, and want to learn more about algorithms.
many are also impressed by how large numbers we can compute with one of the algorithms, it is nothing compared to the math neccecery to display graphics on a screen over 60 times a second.

## Running the notebook

By replacing the `https://github.com/` part of the link to this site with `http://colab.research.google.com/github/` you can open the notebook and run it. 
The full link to then becomes:
https://colab.research.google.com/github/VZtypeM/ENT3R/blob/master/Fibonacci-Run-Time/Fibonacci-Run-Time.ipynb

Note that you will get warnings when you try to run it, because it is possible to include virus in the code, 
but you can see all the code, I don't know any exploits I can run, and I am a nice guy. So that is not going to happen.
